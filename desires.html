  <h3>Desires to Achieve</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>My desires in my next job which is being an <a href="https://amazonationph.com/asva/">Amazon VA</a>
      are really to help the seller on his/her goal in achieving more sales and
      more satisfied customers. </li>
    <li>I would really do my best and do whatever it takes to achieve these
      desires by giving best in studying and applying what I learned from the
      training and along the actual job already.</li>
    <li>I believe, as a problem solver, I can achieve those desires. Thus,
      this will also help me in my personal goal to be able to support for
      my parents financial needs and mine as well.</li>
